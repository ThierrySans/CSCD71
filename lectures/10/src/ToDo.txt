Improvement:
- Verify ECDSA signature in Circom using: https://github.com/personaelabs/spartan-ecdsa

Potential errors:
- in all of them: Users might do transactions off-chain and at the same time withdraw from contract.
- in zk-proof: users might deposits by creating a new tree with two different balances for the same user.
